          <h1>ABOUT</h1>

<p class="section">
Pray for Sound had its origins as a solo studio project started by Bruce Malley in late 2011. He had been diagnosed with a large destructive cyst called a cholesteatoma growing inside his left ear that inhibited his hearing. Despite doctors’ best efforts, he was left with severe hearing loss, tinnitus, and recurring pain. To many musicians and songwriters such a development would be a death sentence, but Malley used his ordeal as inspiration, translating these intensely emotional experiences into instrumental post-rock compositions. Steve Aliperta, Joe Aylward, Chris LaRocque, and Nick Stewart were recruited to help Malley bring Pray for Sound to the stage, and the band quickly made a name for themselves in their native Boston area.
</p>

<p class="section"><br/></p>
The third release from Pray for Sound, Everything Is Beautiful, communicates the dichotic concept of light vs. dark without a single spoken word. As the follow up to the band’s 2014 album Dreamer, Everything Is Beautiful marks an all in decision to dedicate their energies towards the band. “The five of us left our ‘real lives’ behind in Massachusetts and relocated up to Glover, Vermont for eight days with all our music equipment,” recalls Malley. “No distractions or stress.” Removing all societal participation built quite a euphoric experience for the band, and allowed them to find renewed creativity in their songwriting. Eleven new songs found on Everything Is Beautiful feature turbulent guitar riffs and heart pounding drums accompanied by sweeping and all encompassing undercurrents of sound that evoke the likes of My Bloody Valentine, Tycho, and Explosions in the Sky. “We discovered a newfound excitement for the music we were making,” says Malley of the time spent writing and recording Everything Is Beautiful. “We took our time to finish our ideas, and the end result is something we're all incredibly proud of.”
</p>

<p class="section"><br/></p>
Everything Is Beautiful was written, recorded, produced, and mixed by the band themselves. Pray for Sound will begin hinting new songs and content from Everything Is Beautiful beginning September 2nd, 2016 as pre-orders for the album begin. The band is accompanied by a united release from I Am Shark, AM/FM Records, and Dunk! Records (UK) coordinating a full-length release via Digital/CD/Vinyl/Merch on September 23rd, 2016.

          Pray for Sound started as a solo studio project by Bruce Malley in late 2011. Bruce had been diagnosed with a large destructive cyst called a cholesteatoma growing inside his left ear, inhibiting his hearing. Despite doctors’ best efforts, he was left with severe hearing loss, tinnitus, and reoccurring pain. Using his ordeal as inspiration, Bruce translated these emotional experiences into the five songs that make up Pray for Sound's debut album, Monophonic. Shortly after releasing Monophonic, in September of 2012, Steve Aliperta, Joe Aylward, Chris LaRocque, and Nick Stewart were recruited to help Bruce bring Pray for Sound to the live scene in their hometown of Boston, Massachusetts.
</p>

<p class="section"><br/></p>
          
<p class="section">
As the band strengthened their live show, they developed a rapport as musicians and friends, eventually writing as a collaborative effort and releasing their first single as a full band, “23:55”.
</p>

<p class="section"><br/></p>

<p class="section">
After returning from their first tour of New England the band dove into writing and recording their second release, eventually taking the form of a full length called Dreamer. With the writing process being a new collaborative approach as compared to Monophonic, the band branched out in search of new sounds and textures, inviting several other talented musicians from the Boston area to lend their skills to bring the record to life. Dreamer was originally released digitally, on CD, and on cassette (via Flesh and Bone Records) on July 9th, 2014. The band worked with well respected label Science of Silence to also release Dreamer on vinyl in November of 2014.
</p>

<p class="section"><br/></p>

<p class="section">
In 2014 several artists remixed Dreamer at the request of Pray for Sound, creating Dreamixer. The record features a remix of every track on Dreamer in an excitingly unique way, and plays into the record’s central theme of how perception defines experience.
</p>

<p class="section"><br/></p>

<p class="section">
Following what the band felt was a very successful record cycle for Dreamer (considering it was entirely self written, funded, and recorded) the band took an extended break. The process of writing Dreamer, while ultimately gratifying, was strenuous and slow. Founding member Bruce Malley used the down time to craft the ideas that eventually turned into the band’s third proper release, Everything is Beautiful.
</p>

<p class="section"><br/></p>

<p class="section">
With the mood the initial demos created by Bruce and Nick in mind, the band designed a theme of dichotomy to reinforce as they traveled to a beautiful isolated cabin in Glover, Vermont to spend a week writing what eventually became Everything is Beautiful. After using the last two days at the cabin to capture its unique sonic character for the drum tracks on the ‘dark’ side of the record, the band returned to Massachusetts to finish the remaining half of the record, much of which was written by Nick Stewart.
</p>

<p class="section"><br/></p>

<p class="section">
Everything is Beautiful was released September 23rd, 2016. The band considers the record not only a victory as a creative expression, but also a rebirth in what they believe they’re capable of. They only hope that the exceptionally kind and dedicated fans of Pray for Sound find it as meaningful as they do and hope to see everybody out on the road in 2017.

Pray for Sound started as a solo studio project by Bruce Malley in late 2011. Earlier in Bruce's life, doctors discovered a large destructive cyst called a cholesteatoma growing inside his left ear. After repeated surgical removal of the cyst and reconstruction of his ear, he was left with severe hearing loss, tinnitus, and reoccurring pain. Inspired by this struggle, Bruce translated these emotional experiences into the music and artwork that make up Pray for Sound's debut album, Monophonic.

          <p class="section">
Shortly after releasing Monophonic, in September of 2012, Joe Aylward, Chris LaRocque, Nick Stewart, and Steve Aliperta were added to the mix to create an intense live experience with a monstrous sound and an intricate light show.  After immediately meshing as band and playing a handful of successful shows in the greater Boston area, the new members began bringing unique song ideas to the table.  "With three guitarists and all five band members contributing, we have the opportunity to create huge, atmospheric songs that really push boundaries", Malley explains. 23:55, the band's first single written by all five members, tells the story of the end of the world.  The song features heavy riffs, melodic leads, and dueling drums that create an eerie tension throughout.
          </p>
        
          <p class="section"><br/></p>
        
          <p class="section">
Less than a year after becoming a band, Pray for Sound set out on their first DIY tour, playing 11 shows in 12 days throughout the North East United States. After returning from the tour, the band collectively decided to focus on writing new material for their second major release, Dreamer. Dreamer is a seven song full length clocking in at just over 33 minutes, with each track representing a different dream state. This time around, Pray for Sound took an ambitious approach by experimenting with more synth and keyboard sounds, as well as working with additional musicians to add vocals, violin, and viola. With influences all over the map, Pray for Sound created an eclectic set of songs that express a roller coaster of emotions. Dreamer was originally released digitally, on CD, and on cassette (via Flesh and Bone Records) on July 9th, 2014. 
          </p>

          <p class="section"><br/></p>
          
          <p>
Shortly after Dreamer's release, Pray for Sound inked a deal with Science of Silence records joining bands such as Set and Setting, If These Trees Could Talk, Junius, and more to release Dreamer on vinyl.  The limited-edition vinyl will be available in three color variants: white (200), purple/clear swirl (150), and magenta/clear swirl (150) on November 18th, 2014.
