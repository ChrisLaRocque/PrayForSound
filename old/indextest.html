              If you didn't already hear through our social media accounts, we'll be joining a ton of incredible bands at Dunk!Festival in Zottegem, Belgium in May.  While across the pond, we'll be playing a handful of shows in the surround areas with some exciting bands too.  We're also currently planning a few one off shows and runs in the US.
              <br/><br/>
In the meantime, Chris and Steve have been incredibly busy recording hit records at <a href="http://www.kennedystudios.productions">Kennedy Studios</a>, and we're all having fun demoing out new material.
<br/><br/>
See you soon.

              Everything Is Beautiful has been in the works for over two years and today we finally get to share it with you. Our Bandcamp page is streaming the full album, physical orders will be shipping over the next few days, and all other major media outlets such as iTunes, Amazon, and Spotify will have the album VERY soon, if not already.
              <br/><br/>
Bundles and limited edition merch is still available on our store but only for a limited time. If you're interested in these, grab one while you can! 
Over the next few months we'll also be publicly releasing more content including a 20 minute making of documentary and a full live session of us playing the entire album in the cabin we wrote it.

We hope you enjoy the album. Your support means the world to us.\
