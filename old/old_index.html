We closed out 2018 and began 2019 working extremely hard on our next full length, full band record.  The plan is to do a few shows early in the year, release our new record in the Fall,  support with a US tour, and hopefully go across the pond again in 2020.  We have a ton to do, but it's all going to be worth it soon.  Peace and love.

Waiting Room is available on all digital media outlets and streaming services as of today.
<br/><br/>
Waiting Room is a bit of a departure from our previous releases and is much more laid back and ambient. After returning from our European tour in 2017, we were excited to write new music together. Unfortunately, to us, our demos were sounding a lot like our previous records. We already did that and covered that sound. We decided to temporarily take a step back and dive more into the world of synths and lo-fi ambience. These songs are a lot more stripped back. Some follow standard verse/ chorus structure. Some are built on a single part. We played with lots of different writing techniques and it helped reset our minds musically.

Our European tour (with Lost in Kiev and Labirinto) and North East US tour (with InAeona) were both huge successes.  Thank you to all involved and those who came out to support Pray for Sound.

What's left over of our limited tour merch is now available on our <a href="https://prayforsound.bandcamp.com/merch">store</a>.  We also have left over European tour posters, which we'll be giving away at future shows for free.
<br/><br/>
We'll be working on several surprises throughout the summer and playing the first ever Dunk!USA (with Pelican, Coastlands, Set and Setting, and more TBA) in Burlington, Vermont in the fall.  See you out there.

              If you didn't already hear through our social media accounts, we'll be joining a ton of incredible bands at Dunk!Festival in Zottegem, Belgium in May.  While across the pond, we'll be playing a handful of shows in the surrounding areas with some exciting bands too.  We're also currently planning a few one off shows and runs in the US.
              <br/><br/>
In the meantime, Chris and Steve have been incredibly busy recording hit records at <a href="http://www.kennedystudios.productions">Kennedy Studios</a>, and we're all having fun demoing out new material.
<br/><br/>
See you soon.
